# Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript, DOM, Values & Data Types, and Operators

In my JavaScript learning journey, Day 1 was filled with important concepts. This README provides a summary of the key points covered. During this day, I delved into the fundamentals of JavaScript, starting with an introduction to the language itself. Additionally, I learned about the Document Object Model (DOM), values, data types, and operators. To reinforce my understanding, I dedicated time to solving three coding exercises, allowing me to practice and enhance my skills.

## Lesson Summary
<*> Introduction to JavaScript: During my exploration, I gained knowledge about the fundamental aspects of JavaScript as a programming language. I familiarized myself with its integral role in web development and discovered the extensive array of applications it offers.

<*> DOM: During my exploration, I uncovered the concept of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the hierarchical structure of HTML documents as a tree-like arrangement. This hierarchical representation not only enables dynamic manipulation and interaction with web pages using JavaScript but also assists the programmer in effectively accessing and modifying various elements within the page. It proves to be a valuable tool for developers, empowering them to navigate and manipulate the DOM effortlessly.

<*> Values & Data Types: In my journey, I explored JavaScript's value and data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, and objects. I also learned how to declare variables and assign values to them.

<*> Operators : I acquired comprehension of diverse operators within JavaScript. These encompass arithmetic operators for mathematical calculations, comparison operators for value comparisons, and logical operators for combining conditions.
