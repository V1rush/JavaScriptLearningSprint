# Day 2: Expressions, Arrays, and Objects
The following README file provides a concise overview of the JavaScript lessons covering expressions, arrays, and objects. 
Within these lessons, we delve into the utilization of expressions to derive values, the manipulation of arrays, as well as the creation and manipulation of objects.


## Lesson 1: <Expressions>

Expressions are considered as fundemetnal knowledge of the JavaScript language and any other language, here are the key points covered in today's lesson:

first off an expression is a combination of code elements in a programming language that evaluates to some value.

<*> Expressions in JavaScript produce values: so when JavaScript encounters an expression it processes it and produces a value equivalent to that expression.
<*> They can be simple, like variables or literals.
<*> They can also be complex, involving operators and functions.
<*> Expressions are used for operations and assigning values.
<*> JavaScript allows us to store expressions by a declaration and an assignment of them as variables.
<*> JavaScript evaluates expressions based on the order of operations and resolves them to a value.
